# misc

Place to put misc things that aren't big enough to warrant their own separate
repo.

 * `assets` - Static assets (graphics, textures, visualizations, 3d models, etc)
              that I've made or require elsewhere in this repo.
 * `embedded` - Toolchains and experiments with embedded development boards.
 * `ideas` - Small-scale explorations of random ideas I come up with.
 * `sandbox` -  Place for fast-paced tinkering with libraries, engines,
                frameworks, etc.
 * `snippets` - Bits of code I might want to use later that don't fit in a
                standalone library.
 * `tests` - Stuff for learning what happens when edge-cases are hit and limits are
             reached. Also has benchmarks and speed tests.
 * `tools` - Small scripts and tools that I use.
 * `trash` - Things takes up space here that I also don't want to delete.
