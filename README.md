# misc

Place to put misc things that aren't big enough to warrant their own separate
repo.

 * `ideas` - Implementations of random ideas I come up with.
 * `sandbox` -  Place for fast-paced tinkering with libraries, engines,
                frameworks, etc.
 * `embedded` - Toolchains and experiments with embedded development boards.
 * `snippets` - Code snippets I might want to use later.
 * `tests` - Minimal test cases to answer random questions I have about how
             things work.
 * `tools` - Small scripts and tools that I use.
 * `assets` - Misc static assets I've made or use elsewhere here. Think
              graphics, visualizations, 3d models, textures, etc.
 * `trash` - Stuff that takes up space here that I also don't want to delete.
