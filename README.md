# misc

Place to put things that aren't big enough to warrant their own repo.

- `benchmarks/` - Testbeds to see how fast stuff is.
- `experiments` - Answers to my questions about if & how stuff works.
- `ideas` - Small PoCs for the misc ideas I come up with.
- `sandbox` - Envs to mess around with libraries, tools, dev boards, etc.
- `tools` - Small tools I've made, probable graduates to actual projects.
- `trash` - Things idk where else to put.
